# VagrantLamp
A simple LAMP stack using Vagrant and Puppet.
This is for you if you want to do PHP web development on a virtual machine with the basics set up for you.

Alternatively you can use something like https://puphpet.com, but that didn't work for me.

## Components
  * Ubuntu 16.04
  * PHP 7.0
  * Apache 2.4
  * MySQL 5.7
  * Puppet 3.8

## Getting Started
  - Install VirtualBox and Vagrant
  - Clone this repository
  - In your CLI go to your project directory and execute `vagrant up`
  - Wait for vagrant and puppet to finish (this will take a while)
  - DONE!
